# uniqueidentifier


The main idea of this code is to generate a unique
identifier for each batch and the when again the 
batch name is given it should print the same identifier.


The main program was written in Java and the identifiers
are store in mysql which was done using hibernate.

For this program to run on your corresponding desktop
just download the company file and run it in eclipse 
ide.

When you run the program two case situations will arise
first one is to enter the batch number and the second is to retrieve 
the identifier number by giving the batch file number.
 In both the cases You just give the batch number the 
unique identifier is generated by itself.
